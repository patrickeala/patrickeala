### Hey there, I'm Patrick! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an AI engineer with a passion for Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Robotics. I hold a Masterâ€™s in Computing (AI specialization) from the National University of Singapore and currently work in autonomous driving perception and robotic systems.

#### What I Do

- ðŸ§  **Deep Learning:** Designing and training models for perception, object detection, and scene understanding.
- ðŸ‘€ **Computer Vision:** Building systems that help machines make sense of the world, from 2D/3D object detection to large-scale dataset creation.
- ðŸ¤– **Robotics:** Applying AI to create intelligent, autonomous agents that interact with complex real-world environments.

#### What Iâ€™m Interested In

- Autonomous driving and intelligent robot systems
- Multi-modal computer vision, perception, and fusion (LiDAR, camera, radar)
- Dataset creation and automated annotation

When Iâ€™m not working on AI projects, youâ€™ll find me on the football pitch (Iâ€™ve played since I was five!) or on the tennis court (forever working on that backhand).

#### Letâ€™s Connect

Iâ€™m always open to discussing collaboration, sharing ideas, or just talking about AI, football, or tennis. Feel free to reach out!
