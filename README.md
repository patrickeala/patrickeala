### Hey there, I'm Patrick! ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about Artificial Intelligence, with a specific focus on Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Robotics. I recently completed my Master's in Computing with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence from the National University of Singapore. I'm ready for my next adventure and am currently seeking a full-time job.

#### My interests include:

- ðŸ§  Deep Learning: I love exploring the limitless possibilities of deep learning algorithms and their applications in various domains.
- ðŸ‘€ Computer Vision: The ability to teach machines to perceive the world through visual data fascinates me, and I enjoy working on computer vision projects.
- ðŸ¤– Robotics: The prospect of building intelligent machines that can interact with the physical world is something that continuously drives my curiosity and motivation.

When I'm not diving deep into the world of AI and technology, you can find me indulging in my other passions:

- âš½ Football: I've been playing football since I was five years old. Nothing beats the high of stepping onto the field!
- ðŸŽ¾ Tennis: I picked up a racket recently. I'm still a newbie, but I love the sport.
